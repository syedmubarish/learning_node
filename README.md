# Browser vs node

In browser, we interact with WEB API like DOM,cookies etc.
Node doesn't have document,window and all other objects provided by browser 

Browser doesn't have functionalities like file system access
Node have this provided by modules

With node we control environment
With browser,we are at mercy of user 
For eg:If the user choose internet explore,we have more work to do
